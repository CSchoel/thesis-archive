# Statistics on BioModels database

To run the statistics script in this folder, you first have to download all relevant model files from [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels).
To do so follow these instructions:

1. Go to the [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels) website.
2. Click on "Browse" -> "All Models".
3. Add `&sort=submission_date-asc` to the URL.
4. Skip to the first model that was published in 2014 (around `offset=920`).
5. Choose "Select all" -> "Download" to download the following files in batches of 20 to not strain the database too much.
6. Extract all downloaded archives into the folder `since2014`.
