# Dissertation archive of C. SchÃ¶lzel

This archive contains all datasets, code and analyses that I created during my PhD thesis and that were not already published elsewhere.

Where third-party rights are involved, I link to private repositories at my working group, which can be accessed upon request to [Prof. Dr. Andreas Dominik](https://www.thm.de/mni/andreas-peter-dominik).
For the case that these repositories are no longer available in the future, I also keep a private copy of them myself.

Some parts are still marked as TODO, which means that the files are not yet uploaded to this repository or not fully described.

## Data

### Parameters and Variables of the SHM

* TODO: Notizen/Normal_values.ods

    References for which value ranges of HRV measures are to be considered "normal" for a healthy population
* TODO: Notizen/Parameters.ods

    Parameter names and values in SHM

    -> Maybe put into SHM repo?

* TODO: Notizen/Performance_Matlab_JSim_Modelica.ods

    Performance comparison between Matlab, JSim and Modelica

## Code

### Jupyter notebook: Power of frequency bands

TODO: Notizen/PSD of frequency bands.ipynb

### Preliminary studies performed by students

For these projects, you need access to [Magrathea](https://magrathea.mni.thm.de/), the internal Redmine instance used by the working group of Prof. Dr. Andreas Dominik.
If you are interested in this work, please either contact Prof. Dominik or me via mail.

## Notes

### Study of *Cardiovascular physiology concepts*

As part of my preparation for the PhD thesis, I read the following book:

Klabunde, R.E. (2012). Cardiovascular physiology concepts (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).

I took notes in the form of a large mindmap which was generated with [Docear](https://docear.org/) and contains vector graphic images which I created myself and published in the [svgap](https://github.com/CSchoel/svgap) project.

* `notes/cpc/Heart.mm` - Main mindmap file
* `notes/cpc/images` - Image files referenced in Mindmap
* `notes/cpc/images/origins.md` - Lists origin of images that I did not create myself
* `notes/cpc/images/animations` - Contains SVG animations of the ion channel states during an action potential, also published separately as [svgap](https://github.com/CSchoel/svgap).
