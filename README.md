# Dissertation archive of C. Sch√∂lzel

This archive contains all datasets, code and analyses that I created during my PhD thesis and that were not already published elsewhere.

Where third-party rights are involved, I link to private repositories at my working group, which can be accessed upon request to [Prof. Dr. Andreas Dominik](https://www.thm.de/mni/andreas-peter-dominik).
For the case that these repositories are no longer available in the future, I also keep a private copy of them myself.

### Study of *Cardiovascular physiology concepts*

As part of my preparation for the PhD thesis, I read the following book:

Klabunde, R.E. (2012). Cardiovascular physiology concepts (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).

I took notes in the form of a large mindmap which was generated with [Docear](https://docear.org/) and contains vector graphic images which I created myself and published in the [svgap](https://github.com/CSchoel/svgap) project.
